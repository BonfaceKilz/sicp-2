# Symbolic data

Until now we were using expressions and numerical data as part of our
programs. Beside them we can use as well symbols, which are data that
literally stands for itself. Having no value and not representing the
expression which is evaluated, just existing in the system the way it
is.

## Quotation

Symbols are created by quoting the expressions. Like '(a b c).
In Scheme standard primitive operations on lists can be used as well on
the symbolic data itself.
