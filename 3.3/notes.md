# Modeling with mutable data

Until now, we have defined data abstraction as data hidden behind
procedures that acted as constructors, selectors and predicates.
Now, we introduce possibility to change the data, therefore in our
abstraction we introduce another kind of procedure, mutator.

Data objects whose data can be mutated are called `mutable data objects`
