# 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with higher-order procedures

In general, this chapter is dedicated to explanation the properties of
procedures as first-order citizens in Scheme and the way that can be
used to build up abstractions.

First-order citizen in a programming language is entity that has
following properties:

* can be stored in variables and data structures
* can be passed as a parameter to a subroutine
* can be returned as the result of a subroutine
* can be constructed at run-time
* has intrinsic identity (independent of any given name)

See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_object) for
more details on that.
