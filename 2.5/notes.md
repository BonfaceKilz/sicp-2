# Systems with generic operations

In previous chapter we have introduced the way to abstract the
differences in representation of two data abstractions that represent
the same thing. We introduced the notion of encapsulating knowledge
about relations between related data abstractions.

Here, we bring this idea to a broader level. Previously we had different
representations of complex numbers involved, now we go one abstraction
up and we make generic arithmetic which works with numbers in general.
