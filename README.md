# SICP Readig excercise

On August the 1st of 2011 I started a project which was to improve my
programming skills to a new level of understanding the magic of computer
programming.

SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) is a masterpiece of
Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman on basics of computer programming taken from a point of view of
a magician. Magician whose imagination is the only limit for the
achievements in the field of modeling of knowledge into processes which
are to be executed on machines.

### Goal

My goal is to 

  * Read the [SICP book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
  * Watch the [MIT 6.001 course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) videos
  * Do excercises from the book
  * Keep track of my progress in written form so other can eventually
    have benefit from this.

### Process

After I passed more then a third of examples I have installed
[CHICKEN](http://call-cc.org/) Scheme compiler and interpreter to run
examples. It is better in supporting standards, comes with additional
libraries that can be installed, it is MUCH faster and gives much better
error messages with proper bracktraces.

I used [Heist](https://github.com/jcoglan/heist) Scheme interpreter
written in Ruby which should be sufficient for development of the
excercises given in the book. I use Vim for and IDE.

Also I use [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) for deeper debugging and
analysis of the problems.


Usually I go this way through the material:
  1. Watch the video lecture, or the part of it while taking notes
  2. Get through notes and clarify concepts and ideas explained mostly
     trying to reflect on them myself without external help
  3. Go through book and do excercises one by one. I save excercises in
     separate files where I add notes and reflections on them.

Of course, I don't tend to do this in one take, I do it continuously
when I have free time but trying to dedicate as much time as I can to
this so I don't lose the track of where I stoped.
