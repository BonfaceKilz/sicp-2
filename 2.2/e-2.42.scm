; Exercise 2.42.

; The ``eight-queens puzzle'' asks how to place eight queens on a
; chessboard so that no queen is in check from any other 
; (i.e., no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal).
; One possible solution is shown in figure 2.8. One way to solve the
; puzzle is to work across the board, placing a queen in each column. Once
; we have placed k - 1 queens, we must place the kth queen in a position
; where it does not check any of the queens already on the board. We can
; formulate this approach recursively: Assume that we have already
; generated the sequence of all possible ways to place k - 1 queens in the
; first k - 1 columns of the board. For each of these ways, generate an
; extended set of positions by placing a queen in each row of the kth
; column. Now filter these, keeping only the positions for which the queen
; in the kth column is safe with respect to the other queens. This
; produces the sequence of all ways to place k queens in the first k
; columns. By continuing this process, we will produce not only one
; solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.

; We implement this solution as a procedure queens, which returns a
; sequence of all solutions to the problem of placing n queens on an n√ó
; n chessboard. Queens has an internal procedure queen-cols that returns
; the sequence of all ways to place queens in the first k columns of the
; board.

(define (queens board-size)
  (define (queen-cols k)  
    (if (= k 0)
        (list empty-board)
        (filter
         (lambda (positions) (safe? k positions))
         (flatmap
          (lambda (rest-of-queens)
            (map (lambda (new-row)
                   (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
          (queen-cols (- k 1))))))
  (queen-cols board-size))

; In this procedure rest-of-queens is a way to place k - 1 queens in the
; first k - 1 columns, and new-row is a proposed row in which to place
; the queen for the kth column. Complete the program by implementing the
; representation for sets of board positions, including the procedure
; adjoin-position, which adjoins a new row-column position to a set of
; positions, and empty-board, which represents an empty set of
; positions. You must also write the procedure safe?, which determines
; for a set of positions, whether the queen in the kth column is safe
; with respect to the others. (Note that we need only check whether the
; new queen is safe -- the other queens are already guaranteed safe with
; respect to each other.)
; -------------------------------------------

; First to define empty board, that is easy. Since we are going to store
; the positions as list of pairs, then empty board means empty list

(define empty-board nil)

; The way we generate all the possible positions queen can be in the new
; iteration is defined by the rest of queens (valid solutions the
; smaller problem set) and new row injected into the problem. So we have
; to generate combinations.
